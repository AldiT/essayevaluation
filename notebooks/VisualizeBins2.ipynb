On the other hand, the example of countries such as Canada, Japan, France, etc., Brazil should also charge a monthly fee of students coursing public universities. It would be more fair!\n",

A good leader teaches, helps, listens, and understand what the problem or situation is about. A good leader never complains, never desistes, take care others. a good leader persuades, motivates, shows the way to resolve. When a leader stop listens its collegue probably it's time to renovate. anyone can be an excellent leader, but actually anybody does not want to, because of our culture, or ourway to think.

I know you have got a claustrophobia and it is not easy for you to stay in small rooms, but I think if you explain your situation to your colleagues and boss, they maybe can help you and give you a new workplace in a larger room. You can tell them you need a place where you can escape quickly and easily, maybe near the stairs or the emergancy exit. This would help you not to panic so quickly and it'll make the situations for you less dangerous. In addition ask for a CBT it'll may help you. Love, Caro\n",

The major problem is their strength. We could be very loosely connected, this means it is easy to expand unnecessary rumors or our plans to other people. And it is easy to obtain personal data through networking site. There are many networking sites like ProfileMe or Neterwor etc. and each of them have feature for how to use or how to keep information from other people. Although, we have to think about creating specific company policies that limit what our employees share online to keep our company's information in proper way.

      "      I took up rock climbing when I was just a younger. It was extremely enjoyable, and I gradually became a more-than-competent climber. I continued to practice over the next few years, getting better and better. Once, before I arrived to the summit, I found myself on the land. I had a horrible accident, and broke my leg. It was a terrifying experience; I didn't climbing for a long time after that. However, after I had been away from climbing for a long time, I knew that I would always regret it if I didn't face my fears, so I started climbing again. It was difficult at first, but little by little I felt better and improved. I think I've gotten over most of my fears now.\n",

In Brazil, we don't have a severe winter and because of that we don't have snow and this explain why you don't see a lot of Brazilians in the Winter Olympics. You can trust me when I say to you that I like to see, I wouldn't play most of them.

      "      We always use social networking sites to socialze as well as do business, however we have to be carefully when we use networking sites in respect of security. The major problem is their strength. We could be very loosely connected, this means it is easy to expand unnecessary rumors or our plans to other people. And it is easy to obtain personal data through networking site. There are many networking sites like ProfileMe or Neterwor etc. and each of them have feature for how to use or how to keep information from other people. Although, we have to think about creating specific company policies that limit what our employees share online to keep our company's information in proper way. Social networking site is useful but on the other hand we have to be aware the risk in respect of security.\n",

You will be responsible for preparing food for the animals and feeding them daily- it sounds totally exciting because you'll get the chance to prove your skills that you're fearless among dangerous animals like lions, crocodiles etc. Likewise, as I can assess, your salary is by far the highest one in comparison to other extreme jobs.

      "      From the Performance Appraisal Form that Peter has completed recently, I understand that he has had some difficulties to manage the disagreement with the team, and he also has problems to listen to others. It appears obviously Peter need some management training to help him improve these soft skills. I just read the website information from a training organization, HGMS and found it offers 1, 2, 3 day training packages in a range of &quot;soft skills&quot;. I would like to send Peter on the &quot;Conflict Management&quot; course.  The content includes diffusing tension, settling differences, adapting to workplace norms and listening empathetically. I would suggest a 2 day training length. I am sure through this training course, Peter will enhance his team work and listening skills, as a result better integrate into the team.\n",

The bill from an energy supply company is the main &quot;consumer&quot; in the average famylies budget so reducing it is the goal of our mayor who is searching for a public endorsement. Although there is a few major points which make the idea of the buliding considerable. Of course first of all is the cost of a construction relatively to sunlight panels. It is cheaper in the price of panels, instalation of the panels and maintanance. Furthermore there is still need for large sums of the batery for accumulating and suppling a sun power. And the second reason is in the core of wind plants. The last ones is deathly noisy for the insects and mammals in the area of the such plants.Despite we have a planty of offers from both German and local builders, we need to overcome the last handicap - a monopoly of our non-enviromentally frendly suppliers.\n",

The bill from an energy supply company is the main &quot;consumer&quot; in the average famylies budget so reducing it is the goal of our mayor who is searching for a public endorsement. Although there is a few major points which make the idea of the buliding considerable. Of course first of all is the cost of a construction relatively to sunlight panels. It is cheaper in the price of panels, instalation of the panels and maintanance. Furthermore there is still need for large sums of the batery for accumulating and suppling a sun power. And the second reason is in the core of wind plants. The last ones is deathly noisy for the insects and mammals in the area of the such plants.Despite we have a planty of offers from both German and local builders, we need to overcome the last handicap - a monopoly of our non-enviromentally frendly suppliers.\n",

No matter what happened, he never gave up. He was very persistent. He had been an excellent student and later on he was able to turn his academic success into business success. He is incredibly passionate about his work as an entrepreneur today. He has the great ability to find pragmatic solutions to problems. He understands what people want.

      "      We all know how its important to use renewable energy. Ive studied all the sources of renewable energy appropriate for our town carefully. We can use solar panels because we have many summer days during a year, hydroelectricity because we have a strong river with a dam built across it, tidal energy because our town located on the ocean coast with strong tides and even biomass. However, in my opinion, the most beneficial renewable energy to our town will be wind power. Its great that we can convert wind power into electricity by using wind turbines. We have strong winds on out territory and what only we need is to build wind turbines which not so expensive like solar panels. I urge you to take into consideration the fact that the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission materials will be only US$80,000. Furthermore, fuel and maintenance costs will be negligible. From my point of view, there is no doubt that wind energy is the great solution to our issue today.\n",

Almost twenty years later she then met her prince charming, charmed him and now we are all here. Twenty years after she first planned it, it is now here, and my little girl is getting married. Can you believe it? From the first time they met, Y threw her off her feet and into seventh heaven. And as you can see, she is still as happy as ever, since they met. So lets not talk too much, lets celebrate this wonderful wedding, this union between X and Y!\n",

      "      We all know how its important to use renewable energy. Ive studied all the sources of renewable energy appropriate for our town carefully. We can use solar panels because we have many summer days during a year, hydroelectricity because we have a strong river with a dam built across it, tidal energy because our town located on the ocean coast with strong tides and even biomass. However, in my opinion, the most beneficial renewable energy to our town will be wind power. Its great that we can convert wind power into electricity by using wind turbines. We have strong winds on out territory and what only we need is to build wind turbines which not so expensive like solar panels. I urge you to take into consideration the fact that the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission materials will be only US$80,000. Furthermore, fuel and maintenance costs will be negligible. From my point of view, there is no doubt that wind energy is the great solution to our issue today.\n",

      "      I think that every company should build a CSR program. It's not only my opinion, because in Italy even our constitutional law, at his article 41, says that &quot;...the economic activity, both public and private, will be addressed and coordinated towards social purposes&quot;. Other than the law, many companies build projects that underline their giving back to the society. Surely, this will guarantee them some news coverage, but these actions will provide good outcomes. For instance, many companies are sponsoring small sport teams, even in minor sports that otherwise wouldn't have the money to make their activities. Or, other companies devolve some hours of their workers to help the community to maintain public goods like parks, games, schools and so on. These can all be ways to underline the link between an industry and its society, and ultimately can also stimulate their workers to work better, feeling that they are not only working for their salary, but also for a bigger purpose.\n",
