#essayevaluation
===========================================
Our taskâ€™s general goal is to evaluate a piece of writing coming from an English language learner. The evaluation part
takes different aspects of the essay in consideration. For example the used words, spelling mistakes and the repetition
of words. While Automated Essay Scoring (AES) just assigns a summative holistic score for a piece of writing, Automated
Essay Evaluation (AEE) goes a bit further and tries to provide formative feedback. Formative feedback is important for
language learners as it provides guidance in how to improve their writing skills Roscoe et al. (2013). In the end the
input of our system is a piece of writing and the output a list of feedback the learner should get.


Structure of this document
--------------------------

Our project contains two approaches to evaluate a student's writing.

1. A heuristics approach based on the paper by Roscoe et al. (2013)
2. A machine learning approach
