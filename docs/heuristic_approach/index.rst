Before reading any further, you should familiarize yourself with the basic idea behind this approach. We recommend
reading the paper by Roscoe et al. (2013).

If you just want to use this package for production use, you can skip the training section and use the already
pretrained models, which can be found in Google Drive.

If you want to use a different dataset or update the trained model, the training section should help you getting
started.
